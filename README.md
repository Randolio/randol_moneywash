# Randolio: Moneywash (Rewrite) - 20/02/2024

A script that cleans dirty money. Config options are in the server file for enabling fees and percentage cuts, along with multi ped location support.

QB: Finds all the marked bills in your inventory, calculates the total worth, removes the bills and exchanges for cash.
ESX: Counts your total 'black_money' and turns it into cash.

**Note**: For QB, qb-inventory uses info.worth for the marked bills worth. I assume that ox_inventory conversion would use metadata.worth for marked bills. This was tested and worked fine.
