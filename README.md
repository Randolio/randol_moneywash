# Randolio: Moneywash (Rewrite) - 20/02/2024

A script that cleans dirty money. Config options are in the server file for enabling fees and percentage cuts, along with multi ped location support.

- QB: Finds all the marked bills in your inventory, calculates the total worth, removes the bills and exchanges for cash.

- ESX/QB/ND: Counts your total 'black_money' and turns it into cash.

**Note**: For QB, qb-inventory uses info.worth for the marked bills worth. Ox inventory will use black_money as decided by the qbox team. You will have to make adjustments to the bridge yourself if this does not fit your server.
